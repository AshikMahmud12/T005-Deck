            <p>
                There is a lot of exciting stuff going on in the stars above us
                that makes astronomy so much fun. The Universe is constantly
                changing and moving. Some would say it's a "living" thing
                because you never know what you are going to see on any given
                right of stargazing
            </p>
            <br /><br />

            <p>
                Of the many celestial phenomenons, there is probably none as
                exciting as when you see your firstasteroid on the move in the
                heavens. To call asteroids the "rock star" of astronomy is bad
                of jokes and an accurate depiction of how astronomy fans view
                them.Unlike suns,planets, and moons,asteroids are on the movie,
                ever changing and if they appear in the night sky ,they ar
                exciting and dynamic.
